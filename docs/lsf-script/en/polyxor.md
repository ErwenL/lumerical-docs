# polyxor

Combines two polygons into one using the Boolean 'xor' operation. 

The polygon vertices are contained in a single matrix of dimension Nx2 (or 2xN), where N >= 3 is the number of vertices. The dimension 2 corresponds to the x,y positions. For example, a square of side length 1 can be described by V = [ 0,0; 1,0; 1,1; 0,1] or V = [ 0,1,1,0;0,0,1,1].
