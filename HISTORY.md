# LumAPI Documentation Archive - History

**Branch**: `lumapi` (archive only)  
**Status**: Read-only archive of LumAPI documentation  
**Last updated**: 2026-02-07

## Archive Purpose

This branch preserves the LumAPI documentation work that was manually created by AI agents. This work has been **paused indefinitely** due to quality concerns and high resource costs.

## Original Project Goals

The original project aimed to document Lumerical scripting with two main objectives:

1. Provide reliable reference for a Lumerical Script Language VS Code plugin
2. Support automated implementations in a Python package (`lumpy`) based on LumAPI

## LumAPI Documentation Status

### Work Completed
- **Manual AI documentation**: 86 LumAPI command references created by AI agents
- **Quality assessment**: AI-generated documentation was not based on official sources and may contain factual errors
- **Resource cost**: High token consumption with slow progress

### Decision to Pause
- **Quality concerns**: AI-generated documentation without official source verification
- **Efficiency issues**: Manual creation process was too slow and expensive
- **Strategic shift**: Focus moved to scraping official LSF documentation instead

## Current Archive Contents

- **86 LumAPI command references** in [`docs/lumapi/`](docs/lumapi/)
- **Principles document** at [`docs/lumapi-principles.md`](docs/lumapi-principles.md)
- **No active development** - this branch is read-only

## Related Active Work

For active development, please refer to:
- **`main` branch**: LSF documentation scraping from official Ansys Optics website
- **`translation` branch**: Chinese translation of LSF documentation

## Archive Creation

This archive branch was created during project reorganization on 2026-02-07 to separate paused LumAPI work from active LSF documentation efforts.
